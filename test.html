		<div class="intro">
			The first purpose of the test is to understand if the way we sonify data [the Parameter mapping] is clear and useful for our users in this context. Second, we would like to know which type of sound feature is more suitable for the purpose and which between tuned or noise sounds is better at representing and communicating the meaning of our data.
			<br>The experiment is broken down into three steps. In this page you will find the relevant information about how steps are structured and them will work, along with some instructions to guide you during testing.

			<div class="domanda impo">[1] Preliminary Interview</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">Time required:</div> Maximum 30 min;
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">Schedule:</div> After reading all the information presented here on the website, you can move on to complete this preliminary form. No specific knowledge or preparation are required.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">Purpose:</div> The purpose of this first step is profiling the testers who take part in the experiment - once again, thank you! The focus is on gathering an overview of your previous knowledge on water plants, cyber security and audio and music competences.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">How to do it:</div> Clicking here (link) will bring you to the form we ask you to fill out.
			</div>


			<div class="domanda impo">[2] Sonification listening and Questionnaire</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">Time required:</div> More or less 5 minutes every hour for 8 times in a day, repeated for 4 days. Because this is a real - world experiment, we need to test our prototypes during your routine work activity. Therefore, we do not require you to change any habit (except for filling out a very simple and short form once an hour - details below). On the contrary, we strongly encourage you to maintain your usual behaviour at work. This will be highly beneficial to the experiment! The need to preserve a normal working routing is also the reason why each test requires eight hours, i.e., one whole working day. As mentioned, please maintain your eight hours routine during every testing day.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">Schedule:</div> Tests are planned over two weeks but single days for each testing are not cast in stone. Testers can organize their schedule according to individual preferences or commitments, as long as they keep one or two days between each individual test.
				<br>Each prototype will be tested during a regular working day, for a total of 4 days splitted over 2 weeks:
			</div>
			<div class="par1">Week 1 <div class="sub">// 14-18 January</div>
			</div>
			<div class="par2">Day 1 - first scenario;
			</div>
			<div class="par2">
				Day 2 - second scenario;
			</div>
			<div class="par1">
				Week 2 <div class="sub">// 21-25 January</div>
			</div>
			<div class="par2">
				Day 1 - third scenario;
			</div>
			<div class="par3">
				Day 2 - fourth scenario.
			</div>
			
			<div class="rispostaDown">
				<div class="parti">Purpose:</div> This is the core of the test, directly related with the project. The goal is to assess the ease of use and ease of understanding of each prototype validated against the objective of the project. This step is essential for two main reasons: to validate the use of a specific sound and sound characteristics for communicating relevant information on the status of the network to the operator; to evaluate the capability of the operator to correctly understand the meaning of the information conveyed by sound;
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">How it works:</div> During the test, the user will be asked to open the test-application in the morning and then start working normally. Sonification will be played every hour to update on the system status. As mentioned, sonifications have a maximum duration of 10 seconds. After each hourly sonification the tester is asked to complete a short form about what she/he has just heard. Form will be accessible via the test-application. It is very important that the form is completed just after the sonification, since sonifications happen one an hour and it will be easy for you to forget the details of what you heard if completed - say - after 45 minutes from listening. Thanks!
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="parti">Additional steps we ask you to perform before you start testing:</div>
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> Take a picture of the space where you carry out the test, if possible. This is useful for us to see your working environment.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> Before the test begins, check that the volume of your computer (or the device you are using) is on and appropriate. You can use speakers or headphones, as you prefer. But please make sure you will be able to hear the sounds during the whole testing day.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> During the testing days, open the test-application in the morning when you start working. The application needs to remain open during the whole testing day. You can minimize the application window but remember - do not close it! Closing it will automatically switch off all sounds, and with it, the whole test.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> After each sonification session the filling up of a short questionnaire is required (please see above). This will take no more than 3 minutes. The questionnaire will evaluate how well you heard the sonification and how much you got from it. The link to the questionnaire will be available from the test-application, after each sonification.
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> Any personal feedback, opinion and advice will be much appreciated during the Follow up Interview, so, if needed, you are invited to take note during the test.
			</div>

		</div>
		<div class="domanda impo">[3] Follow up Interview</div>
		<div class="risposta">
			<div class="parti">Time required:</div> Maximum 1 hour.
		</div>
		<div class="risposta">
			<div class="parti">Schedule:</div> After the completion of all the tests (4 prototypes). We will try to keep flexible to adjust to your timing, we will ask you, though, to do it the sooner after the tests in order to minimize loss of information and maximize the collection of first impressions. You will be able to express your availability via the Preliminary Interview form.
		</div>
		<div class="risposta">
			<div class="parti">Purpose:</div> To gather insights on possible design issues of the prototypes; to collect details on the use case in the real environment; to better understand the user-prototype relationship; to evaluate increased knowledge and awareness on the topic of sonification; to evaluate increased awareness on how the algorithm/the anomalies alert work and its potentialities for decision making.
		</div>
		<div class="risposta">
			<div class="parti">How to plan it:</div> You will be contacted to set up the interview according to the availability you gave us during the preliminary interview.
