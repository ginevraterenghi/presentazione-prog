			We are two designers from Politecnico di Milano, collaborating with two Water Management Researcher at Singapore University of Technology and Design. We are working to sonifying Cyber Attacks on Water distribution System.
			<br>This website is pointed to people we asked to test our prototype so, thank you for your collaboration. The aim of the website is to introduce the Data Sonification, providing some explanation and examples, and then, express the project idea. You can find here also the sond reading files, that help you before the test to understand the sound used and the kind of data they represent. You can consult these information that will be available during the whole test period. 
			<br>We hope to have provided here all the material you need, but please, contact us if something missing.

			<div class="domanda"></div>
			<div class="risposta">
				Sonification is traditionally defined as the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data [the Sonification Handbook...]. <br>Data Sonification is a particular type of data representation in which data are mapped to sounds to communicate information to the listener. A field of studies since the early 1990s, sonification is still mainly confined to a specialized usage in scientific investigation and process monitoring (seismology, astronomy, real time monitoring in healthcare). <br>Sonification practices range from Audification - the direct translation of waves of various nature (seismic waves, brain waves) into audible waves (i.e., waves oscillating in the audible range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz); to Parameter Mapping - the more complex association of data characteristics to sound parameters (i.e., pitch, amplitude, tempo, timbre).
			</div>
			<div class="domanda impo">Why Sound?</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				Auditory perception has specific advantages in temporal, spatial, amplitude, and frequency resolution that open possibilities as an alternative or complement to visualization techniques. Despite the undeniable predominance of vision in human culture, sound is already successfully present in a variety of contexts of our experience:
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> as a design tool, it conveys both information and emotion. Think of the sound everyday objectsâ€™ emit when we use them: the sound of a specific kettle we have been using for 10 years would alert us when water is ready but would also be part of our emotional home landscape, whether we love it or hate it;
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> as a narrative tool, it enriches the message both at the functional and the emotional level, it builds a story. Think of cinema, and how changing the style of a soundtrack could transform a scene charged with tense expectation in the contemplation of a romantic scenery;
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> perceptually, it intervenes where other senses encounter their limits: the screen has borders that the soundtracks does not have. Think of an indoor scene where the protagonist is lying in bed, the sound of chirping birds coming from outside, and then, suddenly, a terrified scream. How much information are we getting only through sound?
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> it provides a continuous, interactive feedback to our actions: we understand through experience if an action we are doing is performing its task or not: is the car engine working properly? Is the vacuum cleaner stuck? Is the camera taking photos?
			</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				<div class="speciale impo">*</div> it leverages your peripheral attention, thus, we can perform other actions or focus our attention elsewhere while monitoring the situation. Is our baby crying in the other room? Is it raining? Is our neighbor at home upstairs? We would know, while sitting on the sofa in the living room.
			</div>
			<div class="domanda impo">The challenges of Sonification</div>
			<div class="risposta">
				The Geiger counter is among the most successful cases of Data Sonification: the rate of clicking of a Geiger counter conveys the level of radiation in the immediate vicinity of the device. The higher the rate, the higher the amount of radiation. 
				<br>When we move to more ambitious representations of data through sound, though, it is often difficult for the average user to grasp the connection between the data and the sounds, compared to what it is to read a - even complex - diagram on the same data. 
				<br>A reason often quoted as cause of this difficulty is, that sonification lacks a wider context, a general training that visualization have benefitted over the centuries. Our school education, our daily jobs, our communication, is mainly visual. Other reasons might related to the lack of proper technical equipment to diffuse the sonification: how do we listen to a data sonification in a real world environment to perform a daily task? As we all know, sound in digital products can be annoying for us, or for those around us.
				<br>More, sonification projects do not benefit of established, industry-level frameworks (Tableaux, etc) to build specific experiences. Many sonification attempts are coded from scratch for very specific needs and goals.
